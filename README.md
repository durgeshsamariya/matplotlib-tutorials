# Matplotlib Tutorials for Begineers

This repo is all about matplotlib charts -- the basic python data visualization tool.

In the last few months, I was working extensively on plots and to be honest it is hard to remember each and everything and I am tired of looking back and forth in my notebooks for the reference. This hectic process motivates me to prepare this notebook not only for me but also others. Now I dont have to look at different notebooks for the reference only this one enough. I am making this notebook specially copy paste purpose and for beginners to learn matplotlib.

I used different datasets such as titanic, heart-disease, iris, pima-indians-diabetes, heart-failure-clinical data and pokemon datasets available on kaggle. All this datasets are used for visulization purpose only, I not trying to say or interpret any conclusion here.

Enjoy! ðŸ˜„
